# Project Idea: Recipe Sharing Platform

## Description

Build a web application where users can share, explore, and contribute recipes. This project involves user authentication, CRUD operations, and complex querying using GraphQL.

## Features

### User Authentication:

- Implement user registration and login functionality.
- Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization.

### Recipe Management:

- Allow users to create, read, update, and delete their own recipes.
- Include fields like title, description, ingredients, instructions, cooking time, etc.

### Search and Filtering:

- Implement a search functionality to search recipes by title, ingredients, or tags.
- Provide filtering options based on categories, cuisine types, dietary restrictions, etc.

### Likes and Comments:

- Users can like and comment on recipes.
- Implement a feature to display the number of likes and comments for each recipe.

### GraphQL API:

- Expose GraphQL endpoints for querying recipes, users, comments, etc.
- Utilize GraphQL mutations for creating, updating, and deleting data.

### Real-time Updates:

- Implement subscriptions using GraphQL to notify users about new comments, likes, or recipe updates in real-time.

### Integration with External APIs:

- Integrate with external APIs to fetch additional information such as nutritional data or images for ingredients.

### Pagination and Sorting:

- Implement pagination and sorting functionality for browsing large numbers of recipes.

### Security:

- Implement appropriate security measures to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and CSRF attacks.

### Testing:

- Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and stability of your backend.

### Documentation:

- Provide comprehensive documentation for your GraphQL API using tools like GraphQL Playground or GraphiQL.

### Error Handling:

- Implement robust error handling to provide meaningful feedback to users and developers.
